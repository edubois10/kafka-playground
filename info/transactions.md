## Transaction Example

### Question
Can you show an example of a simple quarkus application consuming messages from a kafka topic as a transaction and explain how the transaction works

Sure, here is an example of a simple Quarkus application that consumes messages from a Kafka topic as a transaction:
```
import javax.transaction.Transactional;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Message;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Outgoing;
import org.jboss.resteasy.annotations.SseElementType;
import org.reactivestreams.Publisher;

@ApplicationScoped
public class KafkaConsumer {

    @Incoming("input-topic")
    @Outgoing("output-topic")
    @Transactional
    public Publisher<Message<String>> process(Message<String> message) {
        // Do some processing with the message, for example, persist it to a database
        // ...
        // Return the message to be sent to the output topic
        return message.ack();
    }
}
```
In this example, the process method is annotated with @Incoming("input-topic") to indicate that it is consuming messages from the "input-topic" Kafka topic. The @Outgoing("output-topic") annotation is used to indicate that the method will send the processed message to the "output-topic" topic.

The method is also annotated with @Transactional, which means that the processing of the message will be done within the context of a transaction. This means that if any errors occur during the processing of the message, the transaction will be rolled back and the message will not be sent to the output topic.

When the method returns, the message is acknowledged and sent to the output topic, if the processing is done successfully, otherwise the message will be discarded.

This is a basic example of how you can use transactions to ensure that messages are processed atomically and consistently.



and how would you give feedback to another application in case the transaction failed?
There are several ways to give feedback to another application in case the transaction fails when consuming messages from a Kafka topic:

1. Return an error message to the output topic: In the example above, if the transaction fails, the message will not be sent to the output topic. Instead, you can send an error message to a separate "error-topic" topic, indicating that the processing of the original message failed.

2. Send a notification via a message queue: You can use another message queue such as RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ, to send notifications to other applications in case the transaction fails. The notification message can contain information about the failed transaction, such as the original message and the error that occurred.

3. Send an HTTP or JMS notification: You can send an HTTP or JMS notification to a specific endpoint or destination in case the transaction fails. The notification can contain information about the failed transaction and can be sent via a REST API call or a JMS message.

4. Use callbacks: If the original application that produced the message has provided a callback endpoint, you can use it to provide feedback about the failed transaction.

5. Log the error: You can log the error in a centralized logging system, such as Elasticsearch, Logstash, or Splunk, and make it available to other applications.

Ultimately, the best way to provide feedback will depend on the specific use case and the requirements of the other applications that need to be notified of the failed transaction.


### Question
what is a callback and a callback endpoint in this context?

In the context of message processing, a callback is a mechanism that allows a producer application to provide a specific endpoint or destination for another application (the consumer) to send feedback about the processing of a message.

A callback endpoint is the specific URL, queue or topic, where the consumer application will send the feedback. It's typically passed as a parameter in the message, along with the data that needs to be processed.

For example, a producer application might send a message to a Kafka topic with a callback endpoint, and the consumer application, after processing the message, will send a notification to that endpoint to indicate whether the processing was successful or not.

This way the producer application can be aware of the status of the message and take appropriate action, like retrying the operation, rolling back, or notify other systems.

By providing a callback, the producer application can be sure that it will receive a confirmation that the message has been processed, and can take appropriate action in case of failure.
